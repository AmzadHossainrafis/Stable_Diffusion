# Stable Diffusion( under development )

## Introduction 
Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model designed for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. It leverages advanced techniques in generative modeling to produce realistic and diverse images. This README provides an overview of the dataset used, training procedures, results, and deployment instructions.

## Dataset Overview
### CelebA Face Dataset 

For this project Iam going to use CelebA dataset(note: you can any dataset).The CelebA Face Dataset is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. It is widely used for training and evaluating generative models due to its diversity and richness in facial attributes.

## How to Train

### Train VAE
To train the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), follow these steps:

1. Install requirements
    ```bash 
    $ pip install . 
    
    ```
    for training the vae there is no other requrement without pytorch 
    you can find the more , about [pytorch installation](https://pytorch.org/) 

2. Configure the training parameters.
    ```py
    #change the dataset dir in the config 
     
    config = {
        "batch_size": 35, 
        "dataset_dir": r"/celb_face/img_align_celeba/", #<------ change this 
        .
        . }
    ```
    also change all the dir and change all the other config according to you rig (note : must train very good amount of epoch ) 
3. Train the VAE model using the preprocessed dataset.

    ```py 
    # run python 
    $ python vae_train_pipeline.py

    ```



### Train Stable Diffusion
Once the VAE is trained, proceed with training the Stable Diffusion model:
1. Load the pre-trained VAE model.
2. Initialize the Stable Diffusion model.
3. Configure the training parameters.
4. Train the Stable Diffusion model using the output from the VAE.

## Results
Below are some demo images generated by the Stable Diffusion model:

## Deployment
To deploy the Stable Diffusion model:
1. Export the trained model.
2. Set up the deployment environment.
3. Load the model in the deployment environment.
4. Provide an interface for generating images from textual descriptions.
